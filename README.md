# JumpingMario
This Jumping Mario game project is written in Python. 
The project file contains image files and python code script (mario.py). 
The GUI is built using pygame library. 
The game play is for a single user where the mario has to jump up and down using arrow keys and save mario from hitting the fireballs by the dragon.
After each 10 successful passes of fireballs, the level changes and the cactus from top, fire from downwards and fireballs speed get incremented and if mario get in touch with any of these,the game is over.
In the next level there is less space for mario to jump and prevent from touching all of these and hence difficulty is increased with every level.
And the score is saved as Top score, they can also play to beat there top score everytime.
If user passes level 4 he/she wins.
